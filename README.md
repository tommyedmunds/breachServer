## About <a id="about"></a>

Breach is an electron-based Cybersecurity application intended to keep front-ends safe without doing damage.

This server exists to route all client calls from the companion application. 

## Getting Started <a id="getting-started"></a>

### Download [Breach](https://breachapplication.netlify.app/) and [BreachServer](https://github.com/tommyedmunds/breachServer)

The application can be downloaded for [windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/145yAP5TmEQ5Ti9ohv3nl3cAHoqawgV2Q/view?usp=sharing) or [mac](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRA23lBGhJ-vXaD8gVmvyWeAOaZuZmFR/view?usp=sharing) (Linux option for packaging from codebase is not confirmed.)

This server can be forked and cloned to your local machine. Once it has been cloned, navigate to the correct folder in your terminal and

- Type the following:

```

npm install

Once you have these two items up and running you can get started or use our demo to learn more. We suggest changing the color of the application to your preference first.

### Scan URL <a id="url"></a>
Upon entering a URL the app sends out a request to the server, running tests for instances of innerHTML in the code, cookies and some XSS tests. 
#### Writing the URL for testing XSS 
- The URL must be formatted for a search query (have "q=") in order for the XSS tests to be run.
